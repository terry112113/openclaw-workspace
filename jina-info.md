## [What is Reader?](https://jina.ai/reader/\#what_reader)

![](https://jina.ai/assets/explain-EQrFe5k3.svg)

Feeding web information into LLMs is an important step of grounding, yet it can be challenging. The simplest method is to scrape the webpage and feed the raw HTML. However, scraping can be complex and often blocked, and raw HTML is cluttered with extraneous elements like markups and scripts. The Reader API addresses these issues by extracting the core content from a URL and converting it into clean, LLM-friendly text, ensuring high-quality input for your agent and RAG systems.

## [Reader for web search and SERP](https://jina.ai/reader/\#search)

![](https://jina.ai/assets/explain3-CqNg2V0h.svg)

Reader can be used as SERP API. It allows you to feed your LLM with the content behind the search results engine page. Simply prepend `https://s.jina.ai/?q=` to your query, and Reader will search the web and return the top five results with their URLs and contents, each in clean, LLM-friendly text. This way, you can always keep your LLM up-to-date, improve its factuality, and reduce hallucinations.

_contact\_support_ Ask LLM w/o & w/ Search Grounding

* * *

_info_ Please note that unlike the demo shown above, in practice you do not search the original question on the web for grounding. What people often do is rewrite the original question or use multi-hop questions. They read the retrieved results and then generate additional queries to gather more information as needed before arriving at a final answer.

## [Reader also reads images!](https://jina.ai/reader/\#read-image)

![](https://jina.ai/assets/explain2-BYDhf_rF.svg)

Images on the webpage are automatically captioned using a vision language model in the reader and formatted as image alt tags in the output. This gives your downstream LLM just enough hints to incorporate those images into its reasoning and summarizing processes. This means you can ask questions about the images, select specific ones, or even forward their URLs to a more powerful VLM for deeper analysis!

## [Reader also reads PDFs!](https://jina.ai/reader/\#read-pdf)

![](https://jina.ai/assets/explain4-CPLfQrjf.png)

Yes, Reader natively supports PDF reading. It's compatible with most PDFs, including those with many images, and it's lightning fast! Combined with an LLM, you can easily build a ChatPDF or document analysis AI in no time.

## The best part? It's free!

Reader API is available for free and offers flexible rate limit and pricing. Built on a scalable infrastructure, it offers high accessibility, concurrency, and reliability. We strive to be your preferred grounding solution for your LLMs.

Rate Limit

Rate limits are tracked in three ways: **RPM** (requests per minute), and **TPM** (tokens per minute). Limits are enforced per IP/API key and will be triggered when either the RPM or TPM threshold is reached first. When you provide an API key in the request header, we track rate limits by key rather than IP address.

Understand the rate limit

Rate limits are the maximum number of requests that can be made to an API within a minute per IP address/API key (RPM). Find out more about the rate limits for each product and tier below.

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Rate Limit

Rate limits are tracked in three ways: **RPM** (requests per minute), and **TPM** (tokens per minute). Limits are enforced per IP/API key and will be triggered when either the RPM or TPM threshold is reached first. When you provide an API key in the request header, we track rate limits by key rather than IP address.

Auto top-up on low token balance

Recommended for uninterrupted service in production. When your token balance drops below the set threshold, we will automatically recharge your saved payment method for the last purchased package, until the threshold is met.

_info_ We introduced a new pricing model on May 6th, 2025. If you enabled auto-recharge before this date, you'll continue to pay the old price (the one when you purchased). The new pricing only applies if you modify your auto-recharge settings or purchase a new API key.

## [FAQ](https://jina.ai/reader/\#faq)

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

What are the costs associated with using the Reader API?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Reader API is free for basic usage - simply prepend 'https://r.jina.ai/' to your URL. For higher rate limits, you can provide an API key which charges tokens based on content length. Check Q16 for rate limit details.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

How does the Reader API function?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

The Reader API uses a proxy to fetch any URL, rendering its content in a browser to extract high-quality main content.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

Is the Reader API open source?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Yes, the Reader API is open source and available on the Jina AI GitHub repository.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

What is the typical latency for the Reader API?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

The Reader API generally processes URLs and returns content within 2 seconds, although complex or dynamic pages might require more time.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

Why should I use the Reader API instead of scraping the page myself?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Scraping can be complicated and unreliable, particularly with complex or dynamic pages. The Reader API provides a streamlined, reliable output of clean, LLM-ready text.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

Does the Reader API support multiple languages?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

The Reader API returns content in the original language of the URL. It does not provide translation services.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

What should I do if a website blocks the Reader API?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

If you experience blocking issues, please contact our support team for assistance and resolution.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

Can the Reader API extract content from PDF files?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Yes, the Reader API can natively extract content from PDF files.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

Can the Reader API process media content from web pages?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Yes, Reader can caption images on webpages using the `x-with-generated-alt` header. This adds descriptive alt tags to images that lack them, enabling LLMs to understand visual content. Video summarization is planned for future releases.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

Is it possible to use the Reader API on local HTML files?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

No, the Reader API can only process content from publicly accessible URLs.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

Does Reader API cache the content?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

If you request the same URL within 5 minutes, the Reader API will return the cached content.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

Can I use the Reader API to access content behind a login?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Unfortunately not.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

Can I use the Reader API to access PDF on arXiv?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Yes, you can either use the native PDF support from the Reader (https://r.jina.ai/https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19923v4) or use the HTML version from the arXiv (https://r.jina.ai/https://arxiv.org/html/2310.19923v4)

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

How does image caption work in Reader?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Reader captions all images at the specified URL and adds \`Image \[idx\]: \[caption\]\` as an alt tag (if they initially lack one). This enables downstream LLMs to interact with the images in reasoning, summarizing etc.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

What is the scalability of the Reader? Can I use it in production?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

The Reader API is designed to be highly scalable. It is auto-scaled based on the real-time traffic and the maximum concurrency requests is now around 4000. We are maintaining it actively as one of the core products of Jina AI. So feel free to use it in production.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

What is the rate limit of the Reader API?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Please find the latest rate limit information in the table below. Note that we are actively working on improving the rate limit and performance of the Reader API, the table will be updated accordingly.

[_speed_ Rate limit](https://jina.ai/reader/#rate-limit)

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

What is Reader-LM? How can I use it?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

`ReaderLM-v2` is our latest small language model (SLM) for converting raw HTML into clean markdown or JSON. It offers a 3x quality improvement over v1 and can extract structured data using JSON schema or natural language instructions. You can use it directly via Reader API with the `x-respond-with: readerlm-v2` header, or deploy it from cloud marketplaces (AWS, Azure, GCP).

[_launch_ AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=seller-stch2ludm6vgy) [_launch_ Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?q=jina&pli=1&inv=1&invt=AbmydQ) [_launch_ Microsoft Azure](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace/apps?page=1&search=jina)

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

How do I extract structured data from webpages?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Use the `x-json-schema` header with a JSON schema definition, or use `x-instruction` header with natural language instructions. Both features work with ReaderLM-v2 to extract specific fields like prices, titles, dates, etc. from any webpage into structured JSON format.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

Does Reader actively bypass website anti-bot protection?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

No. Reader does not actively circumvent or bypass any website defense mechanisms, anti-bot systems, or access controls. If a website detects our service as a bot and blocks the request, that outcome is respected. We operate as a standard web client and do not employ techniques designed to evade detection systems.

_![](https://jina.ai/assets/reader-D06QTWF1.svg)_

Will upgrading from a free to a paid API key give me access to more websites?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

No. Upgrading from a free tier to a paid API key does not grant access to additional websites or bypass any site restrictions. The difference between tiers is primarily in rate limits and performance optimizations. A paid API key provides higher request throughput and faster processing, but it does not enable access to websites that block our service.

### [How to get my API key?](https://jina.ai/reader/\#get-api-key)

video\_not\_supported

### [What's the rate limit?](https://jina.ai/reader/\#rate-limit)

Rate Limit

Rate limits are tracked in three ways: **RPM** (requests per minute), and **TPM** (tokens per minute). Limits are enforced per IP/API key and will be triggered when either the RPM or TPM threshold is reached first. When you provide an API key in the request header, we track rate limits by key rather than IP address.

API-related common questions

_code_

Can I use the same API key for reader, embedding, reranking, classifying and fine-tuning APIs?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Yes, the same API key is valid for all search foundation products from Jina AI. This includes the reader, embedding, reranking, classifying and fine-tuning APIs, with tokens shared between the all services.

_code_

Can I monitor the token usage of my API key?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Yes, token usage can be monitored in the 'API Key & Billing' tab by entering your API key, allowing you to view the recent usage history and remaining tokens. If you have logged in to the API dashboard, these details can also be viewed in the 'Manage API Key' tab.

_code_

What should I do if I forget my API key?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

If you have misplaced a topped-up key and wish to retrieve it, please contact support AT jina.ai with your registered email for assistance. It's recommended to log in to keep your API key securely stored and easily accessible.

[Contact](https://jina.ai/contact-sales)

_code_

Do API keys expire?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

No, our API keys do not have an expiration date. However, if you suspect your key has been compromised and wish to retire it, please contact our support team for assistance. You can also revoke your key in [the API Key Management dashboard](https://jina.ai/api-dashboard).

[Contact](https://jina.ai/contact-sales)

_code_

Can I transfer tokens between API keys?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Yes, you can transfer tokens from a premium key to another. After logging into your account on [the API Key Management dashboard](https://jina.ai/api-dashboard), use the settings of the key you want to transfer out to move all remaining paid tokens.

_code_

Can I revoke my API key?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Yes, you can revoke your API key if you believe it has been compromised. Revoking a key will immediately disable it for all users who have stored it, and all remaining balance and associated properties will be permanently unusable. If the key is a premium key, you have the option to transfer the remaining paid balance to another key before revocation. Notice that this action cannot be undone. To revoke a key, go to the key settings in [the API Key Management dashboard](https://jina.ai/api-dashboard).

_code_

Why is the first request for some models slow?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

This is because our serverless architecture offloads certain models during periods of low usage. The initial request activates or 'warms up' the model, which may take a few seconds. After this initial activation, subsequent requests process much more quickly.

_code_

Is my API data used to train your models?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

No. We never use your API requests, inputs, or outputs to train our embedding, reranker, or any other models. Your data remains yours. We are SOC 2 Type I and Type II compliant.

_code_

What are the rate limits for Jina APIs?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Rate limits apply per API key:

**Free:** 100 RPM, 100K TPM, 2 concurrent requests

**Paid:** 500 RPM, 2M TPM, 50 concurrent requests

**Premium:** 5,000 RPM, 50M TPM, 500 concurrent requests

There is also an IP-based rate limit of 10,000 requests per 60 seconds. These limits apply across all Jina APIs (Embeddings, Reranker, Reader, etc.).

_code_

Are there batch size limits for the APIs?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

There is **no batch size limit** for either the Embeddings or Reranker APIs. You can send as many items or documents as needed per request. Both APIs batch inputs internally by token count for optimal GPU utilization.

Billing-related common questions

_attach\_money_

Is billing based on the number of sentences or requests?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Our pricing model is based on the total number of tokens processed, allowing users the flexibility to allocate these tokens across any number of sentences, offering a cost-effective solution for diverse text analysis requirements.

_attach\_money_

Is there a free trial available for new users?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

We offer a welcoming free trial to new users, which includes ten millions tokens for use with any of our models, facilitated by an auto-generated API key. Once the free token limit is reached, users can easily purchase additional tokens for their API keys via the 'Buy tokens' tab.

_attach\_money_

Are tokens charged for failed requests?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

No, tokens are not deducted for failed requests.

_attach\_money_

What payment methods are accepted?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Payments are processed through Stripe, supporting a variety of payment methods including credit cards, Google Pay, and PayPal for your convenience.

_attach\_money_

Is invoicing available for token purchases?

_keyboard\_arrow\_down_

Yes, an invoice will be issued to the email address associated with your Stripe account upon the purchase of tokens.
